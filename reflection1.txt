During my internship, I worked with engineers from several disciplines to manufacture devices for mining and autonomous navigation. A key focus in this environment was improving sustainability by reducing waste and inefficiencies. I was tasked with analysing and reducing the takt time of a manufacturing process, which involved
conducting time studies and reviewing workflow steps. After identifying several inefficiencies, I helped implement changes that reduced touch time by about 15%, lowering labour requirements and improving overall process sustainability. Initially, I felt both excited and uncertain about whether I could make a meaningful
impact. As I progressed, these doubts shifted toward motivation as the data began revealing clear opportunities for improvement. This experience reinforced my belief that sustainability involves both environmental and financial responsibility, and that small optimisations can have significant long-term effects.
One difficulty was ensuring that proposed changes were practical within existing tooling, quality constraints, and worker safety. Considering these perspectives, along with lean manufacturing principles, helped me understand the broader context of sustainable engineering. From this experience, I learned the value of structured analysis and cross-disciplinary collaboration. In the future, I intend to apply sustainability-focused thinking more
deliberately and continue developing my skills in process optimisation.
