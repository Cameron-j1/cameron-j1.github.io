During my time at a defence company, I worked closely with colleagues from multiple countries and cultural backgrounds across several international offices. Collaboration
often required coordinating between different time zones, communication styles, and expectations around engineering workflows. One project involved working with
international teams to integrate components sourced from overseas suppliers, which required clear communication and an understanding of differing workplace norms and
documentation standards. Initially, I felt both curious and slightly apprehensive, unsure whether cultural
differences might lead to misunderstandings. However, I also felt motivated to learn how global teams function effectively in a highly regulated industry like defence. This
experience challenged my assumption that engineering processes are universally approached the same way. I became more aware of how cultural context shapes
communication, problem-solving, and decision-making. A key difficulty was navigating varied communication styles as some teams were very
direct, while others approached discussions more indirectly. Recognising this helped me adjust my communication to avoid ambiguity. Considering perspectives such as
international standards, geopolitical sensitivities, and ethical responsibilities in defence work broadened my understanding of the global context we work within.
From this experience, I learned the value of cultural awareness, patience, and adaptability. Going forward, I intend to develop stronger cross-cultural communication
skills and remain conscious of how global collaboration influences engineering practice.
